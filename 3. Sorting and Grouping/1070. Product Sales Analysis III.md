## [1070. Product Sales Analysis III](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-sales-analysis-iii/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)
* Medium Problem

### Concepts / Syntax
`SUB QUERY`, `WHERE`, `IN`, `MIN()`

### Intuition
1. We need to find the first year of each product. This can be done in the `WHERE` using a `SUB QUERY`
2. Perform our `SELECT` statments 

### Approach
1. We need to find the first year of each product. This can be done in the `WHERE` using a `SUB QUERY`
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Sales
WHERE
    (product_id, year) IN
    (SELECT product_id, MIN(year) FROM Sales GROUP BY product_id)
```
```
| sale_id | product_id | year | quantity | price |
| ------- | ---------- | ---- | -------- | ----- |
| 1       | 100        | 2008 | 10       | 5000  |
| 7       | 200        | 2011 | 15       | 9000  |
```

2. Perform our `SELECT` statments 
```sql
SELECT 
    product_id
    , year as first_year
    , quantity
    , price
FROM Sales
WHERE
    (product_id, year) IN
    (SELECT product_id, MIN(year) FROM Sales GROUP BY product_id)
```
```
| product_id | first_year | quantity | price |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------- | ----- |
| 100        | 2008       | 10       | 5000  |
| 200        | 2011       | 15       | 9000  |
```

### Solution
```sql
SELECT 
    product_id
    , year as first_year
    , quantity
    , price
FROM Sales
WHERE
    (product_id, year) IN
    (SELECT product_id, MIN(year) FROM Sales GROUP BY product_id)
```
