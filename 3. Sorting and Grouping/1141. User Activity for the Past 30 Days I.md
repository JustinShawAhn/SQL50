## [1141. User Activity for the Past 30 Days I](https://leetcode.com/problems/user-activity-for-the-past-30-days-i/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)
* Easy Problem

### Concepts / Syntax
`DATE_SUB`, `COUNT()`, `GROUP BY`

### Intuition
1. We want to filter out all the rows that do not align with our desired date interval.
2. Group by each day of the interval and count how many rows are in each pile

### Approach
1. filter out rows 
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Activity
WHERE
    activity_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB('2019-07-27', INTERVAL 29 DAY) AND '2019-07-27'
```
```
| user_id | session_id | activity_date | activity_type |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | scroll_down   |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | end_session   |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | open_session  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
```

2. Group by each day of the interval and count how many rows are in each pile
```sql
SELECT 
    activity_date AS day
    , COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users
FROM Activity
WHERE
    activity_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB('2019-07-27', INTERVAL 29 DAY) AND '2019-07-27'
GROUP BY activity_date
```
```
| day        | active_users |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| 2019-07-20 | 2            |
| 2019-07-21 | 2            |
```


### Solution
```sql
SELECT 
    activity_date AS day
    , COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users
FROM Activity
WHERE
    activity_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB('2019-07-27', INTERVAL 29 DAY) AND '2019-07-27'
GROUP BY activity_date
```
