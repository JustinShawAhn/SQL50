## [1934. Confirmation Rate](https://leetcode.com/problems/confirmation-rate/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)
* Medium Problem

### Concepts / Syntax
`AVG()`, `IF()`, `LEFT JOIN`, `GROUP BY`

### Intuition
It is easy to filter out the rows that do not have 'confirmed' in them using a `WHERE`, grouping them with `GROUP BY`, and then counting them with `COUNT()` to see how many `confirmed`s we has.

However, in this problem, we don't just need to number of 'confimred' but we need the following formula: 

$$\text{Confirmation Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of 'confirmed' actions form user}}{\text{Total number of actions from user}}$$

This can be done with a `IF()` statement in the `SELECT` clause to filter out 'timeout' from the `GROUP BY` pile.

Then we can take the `AVG()` to find the confirmation rate (see formula above)

### Approach
1. We want all the users from the Signups table whether the have any actions from the Confimations table. Therefore, we use a `LEFT JOIN`

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Signups s
LEFT JOIN Confirmations c
ON s.user_id = c.user_id
```

```
| user_id | time_stamp          | user_id | time_stamp          | action    |
| ------- | ------------------- | ------- | ------------------- | --------- |
| 3       | 2020-03-21 10:16:13 | 3       | 2021-07-14 14:00:00 | timeout   |
| 3       | 2020-03-21 10:16:13 | 3       | 2021-01-06 03:30:46 | timeout   |
| 7       | 2020-01-04 13:57:59 | 7       | 2021-06-14 13:59:27 | confirmed |
| 7       | 2020-01-04 13:57:59 | 7       | 2021-06-13 12:58:28 | confirmed |
| 7       | 2020-01-04 13:57:59 | 7       | 2021-06-12 11:57:29 | confirmed |
| 2       | 2020-07-29 23:09:44 | 2       | 2021-02-28 23:59:59 | timeout   |
| 2       | 2020-07-29 23:09:44 | 2       | 2021-01-22 00:00:00 | confirmed |
| 6       | 2020-12-09 10:39:37 | null    | null                | null      |
```

2. We want to `GROUP BY` s.user_id as we want the start performing aggreation on the action column.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Signups s
LEFT JOIN Confirmations c
ON s.user_id = c.user_id
GROUP BY s.user_id
```

```
| user_id | time_stamp          | user_id | time_stamp          | action    |
| ------- | ------------------- | ------- | ------------------- | --------- |
| 3       | 2020-03-21 10:16:13 | 3       | 2021-07-14 14:00:00 | timeout   |
| 7       | 2020-01-04 13:57:59 | 7       | 2021-06-14 13:59:27 | confirmed |
| 2       | 2020-07-29 23:09:44 | 2       | 2021-02-28 23:59:59 | timeout   |
| 6       | 2020-12-09 10:39:37 | null    | null                | null      |
```

3. Now for tricky part, within each aciton pile, we want to find the sum of 'confirmed' / ('confirmed' + 'timeout'). This is done with 'IF()' followed by 'AVG()'.

```sql
SELECT 
    s.user_id, 
    ROUND(AVG(IF(c.action = 'confirmed', 1, 0)), 2) AS confirmation_rate
FROM Signups s
LEFT JOIN Confirmations c
ON s.user_id = c.user_id
GROUP BY s.user_id
```

```
| user_id | confirmation_rate |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| 3       | 0                 |
| 7       | 1                 |
| 2       | 0.5               |
| 6       | 0                 |
```


### Solution
```sql
SELECT 
    s.user_id, 
    ROUND(AVG(IF(c.action = 'confirmed', 1, 0)), 2) AS confirmation_rate
FROM Signups s
LEFT JOIN Confirmations c
ON s.user_id = c.user_id
GROUP BY s.user_id
```
