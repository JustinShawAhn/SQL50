## [570. Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports](https://leetcode.com/problems/managers-with-at-least-5-direct-reports/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)
* Medium Problem

### Concepts / Syntax
`SELF JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`

### Intuition
The core of solving this problem involves joining the Employee table with itself . This is because you need to look at both employees and their managers, where both are entries in the same Employee table. We are doing row to row comparison

### Approach

1. We `SELF JOIN` to do row comparison. We want to check for matching rows where one row (the `mgr`) is identified as the manager of another row (the `emp`) based on the ID-managerId relationship.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employee mgr
JOIN Employee emp
ON mgr.id = emp.managerId
```

```
| id  | name | department | managerId | id  | name  | department | managerId |
| --- | ---- | ---------- | --------- | --- | ----- | ---------- | --------- |
| 101 | John | A          | null      | 102 | Dan   | A          | 101       |
| 101 | John | A          | null      | 103 | James | A          | 101       |
| 101 | John | A          | null      | 104 | Amy   | A          | 101       |
| 101 | John | A          | null      | 105 | Anne  | A          | 101       |
| 101 | John | A          | null      | 106 | Ron   | B          | 101       |
```

2. Now we must `GROUP BY` the `mgr` name and then filter out any name that does not have at **least 5 direct reports**

```sql
SELECT mgr.name
FROM Employee mgr
JOIN Employee emp
ON mgr.id = emp.managerId
GROUP BY mgr.id
HAVING COUNT(*) >=5
```
```
| name |
| ---- |
| John |
```

### Solution
```sql
SELECT mgr.name
FROM Employee mgr
JOIN Employee emp
ON mgr.id = emp.managerId
GROUP BY mgr.id
HAVING COUNT(*) >=5
```
