## [1661. Average Time of Process per Machine](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-time-of-process-per-machine/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)
* EASY Problem

### Concepts / Syntax
`SELF JOIN`, `GROUP BY`

### Intuition
#### The Core Challenge
The main challenge is that the 'start' and 'end' activities for a given process on a given machine are in separate rows. To calculate the duration, bring these two related rows together into a single logical "event" to subtract their timestamps. This can be done with `SELF JOIN` 


### Approach
1. `SELF JOIN` on `machine_id` and `process_id` to have `s` as the start table and `e` as the end table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Activity s
JOIN Activity e
ON 
    s.machine_id = e.machine_id
    AND s.process_id = e.process_id
```

```
| machine_id | process_id | activity_type | timestamp | machine_id | process_id | activity_type | timestamp |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------- | --------- |
| 0          | 0          | end           | 1.52      | 0          | 0          | start         | 0.712     |
| 0          | 0          | start         | 0.712     | 0          | 0          | start         | 0.712     |
| 0          | 0          | end           | 1.52      | 0          | 0          | end           | 1.52      |
| 0          | 0          | start         | 0.712     | 0          | 0          | end           | 1.52      |
| 0          | 1          | end           | 4.12      | 0          | 1          | start         | 3.14      |
| 0          | 1          | start         | 3.14      | 0          | 1          | start         | 3.14      |
| 0          | 1          | end           | 4.12      | 0          | 1          | end           | 4.12      |
| 0          | 1          | start         | 3.14      | 0          | 1          | end           | 4.12      |
| 1          | 0          | end           | 1.55      | 1          | 0          | start         | 0.55      |
| 1          | 0          | start         | 0.55      | 1          | 0          | start         | 0.55      |
| 1          | 0          | end           | 1.55      | 1          | 0          | end           | 1.55      |
| 1          | 0          | start         | 0.55      | 1          | 0          | end           | 1.55      |
| 1          | 1          | end           | 1.42      | 1          | 1          | start         | 0.43      |
...
```

2. Finding The row in `s` where `activity_type` = 'start' and the corresponding row `e` where `activity_type` = 'end'

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Activity s
JOIN Activity e
ON 
    s.machine_id = e.machine_id
    AND s.process_id = e.process_id
    AND s.activity_type = 'start'
    AND e.activity_type = 'end'
```

```
| machine_id | process_id | activity_type | timestamp | machine_id | process_id | activity_type | timestamp |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------- | --------- |
| 0          | 0          | start         | 0.712     | 0          | 0          | end           | 1.52      |
| 0          | 1          | start         | 3.14      | 0          | 1          | end           | 4.12      |
| 1          | 0          | start         | 0.55      | 1          | 0          | end           | 1.55      |
| 1          | 1          | start         | 0.43      | 1          | 1          | end           | 1.42      |
| 2          | 0          | start         | 4.1       | 2          | 0          | end           | 4.512     |
| 2          | 1          | start         | 2.5       | 2          | 1          | end           | 5         |
```

3. `GROUP BY` `machine_id` to then preform a (`AVG()`) aggregation operation on the timestamps
```sql
SELECT s.machine_id, ROUND(AVG(e.timestamp - s.timestamp), 3) AS processing_time
FROM Activity s
JOIN Activity e
ON 
    s.machine_id = e.machine_id
    AND s.process_id = e.process_id
    AND s.activity_type = 'start'
    AND e.activity_type = 'end'

GROUP BY s.machine_id
```
```
| machine_id | processing_time |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| 0          | 0.894           |
| 1          | 0.995           |
| 2          | 1.456           |
```

### Solution
```sql
SELECT s.machine_id, ROUND(AVG(e.timestamp - s.timestamp), 3) AS processing_time
FROM Activity s
JOIN Activity e
ON 
    s.machine_id = e.machine_id
    AND s.process_id = e.process_id
    AND s.activity_type = 'start'
    AND e.activity_type = 'end'

GROUP BY s.machine_id
```
