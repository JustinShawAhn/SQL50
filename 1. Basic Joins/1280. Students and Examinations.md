* EASY Problem

### Concepts / Syntax
`CROSS JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `GROUP BY`

### Intuition
First, list every possible student-subject scenario (using `CROSS JOIN` aka Cartesian Product). Then for each scenario, we can list how many times it happened bases on the `Examination` table (using `LEFT JOIN`). 

### Approach
1. We want to list every possible student-subject scenario by joining the `Students` with `Subjects` table using a `CROSS JOIN`

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM Students stu
CROSS JOIN Subjects sub
```
```
| student_id | student_name | subject_name |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| 1          | Alice        | Programming  |
| 1          | Alice        | Physics      |
| 1          | Alice        | Math         |
| 2          | Bob          | Programming  |
| 2          | Bob          | Physics      |
| 2          | Bob          | Math         |
| 13         | John         | Programming  |
| 13         | John         | Physics      |
| 13         | John         | Math         |
| 6          | Alex         | Programming  |
| 6          | Alex         | Physics      |
| 6          | Alex         | Math         |
```
> NOTE: The resulting table is very similar to the final output that we want.
```
Expected
| student_id | student_name | subject_name | attended_exams |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------ | -------------- |
| 1          | Alice        | Math         | 3              |
| 1          | Alice        | Physics      | 2              |
| 1          | Alice        | Programming  | 1              |
| 2          | Bob          | Math         | 1              |
| 2          | Bob          | Physics      | 0              |
| 2          | Bob          | Programming  | 1              |
| 6          | Alex         | Math         | 0              |
| 6          | Alex         | Physics      | 0              |
| 6          | Alex         | Programming  | 0              |
| 13         | John         | Math         | 1              |
| 13         | John         | Physics      | 1              |
| 13         | John         | Programming  | 1              |
```

2. Join the `Examinations` table using `LEFT JOIN` so we may see what exams the students took or did not take.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Students stu
CROSS JOIN Subjects sub
LEFT JOIN Examinations e
ON 
    stu.student_id = e.student_id
    AND sub.subject_name = e.subject_name
```
``` 
| student_id | student_name | subject_name | student_id | subject_name |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| 1          | Alice        | Programming  | 1          | Programming  |
| 1          | Alice        | Physics      | 1          | Physics      |
| 1          | Alice        | Physics      | 1          | Physics      |
| 1          | Alice        | Math         | 1          | Math         |
| 1          | Alice        | Math         | 1          | Math         |
| 1          | Alice        | Math         | 1          | Math         |
| 2          | Bob          | Programming  | 2          | Programming  |
| 2          | Bob          | Physics      | null       | null         |
| 2          | Bob          | Math         | 2          | Math         |
| 13         | John         | Programming  | 13         | Programming  |
| 13         | John         | Physics      | 13         | Physics      |
| 13         | John         | Math         | 13         | Math         |
| 6          | Alex         | Programming  | null       | null         |
| 6          | Alex         | Physics      | null       | null         |
| 6          | Alex         | Math         | null       | null         |
```

3. Now we must `GROUP BY` `stu.student_name` but also `sub.subject_name`
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Students stu
CROSS JOIN Subjects sub
LEFT JOIN Examinations e
ON 
    stu.student_id = e.student_id
    AND sub.subject_name = e.subject_name
GROUP BY
    stu.student_name
    , sub.subject_name
```
```
| student_id | student_name | subject_name | student_id | subject_name |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| 1          | Alice        | Programming  | 1          | Programming  |
| 1          | Alice        | Physics      | 1          | Physics      |
| 1          | Alice        | Math         | 1          | Math         |
| 2          | Bob          | Programming  | 2          | Programming  |
| 2          | Bob          | Physics      | null       | null         |
| 2          | Bob          | Math         | 2          | Math         |
| 13         | John         | Programming  | 13         | Programming  |
| 13         | John         | Physics      | 13         | Physics      |
| 13         | John         | Math         | 13         | Math         |
| 6          | Alex         | Programming  | null       | null         |
| 6          | Alex         | Physics      | null       | null         |
| 6          | Alex         | Math         | null       | null         |
```
> NOTE: Now we have came back to a similar table to that we have to output. However, within the `e.subject_name` column, we have row(s) for each distinct `e.subject_name` with a `stu.student_name`. We can use Aggregation Operations to perform analysis on the row(s)

4. Using `COUNT()` we can count how many rows are stacked in each `e.subject_name`
```SQL
SELECT
    stu.student_id
    , stu.student_name
    , sub.subject_name
    , COUNT(e.student_id) AS attended_exams
FROM Students stu
CROSS JOIN Subjects sub
LEFT JOIN Examinations e
ON 
    stu.student_id = e.student_id
    AND sub.subject_name = e.subject_name
GROUP BY
    stu.student_name
    , sub.subject_name
```
```
| student_id | student_name | subject_name | attended_exams |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------ | -------------- |
| 1          | Alice        | Programming  | 1              |
| 1          | Alice        | Physics      | 2              |
| 1          | Alice        | Math         | 3              |
| 2          | Bob          | Programming  | 1              |
| 2          | Bob          | Physics      | 0              |
| 2          | Bob          | Math         | 1              |
| 13         | John         | Programming  | 1              |
| 13         | John         | Physics      | 1              |
| 13         | John         | Math         | 1              |
| 6          | Alex         | Programming  | 0              |
| 6          | Alex         | Physics      | 0              |
| 6          | Alex         | Math         | 0              |
```

5. Simply `ORDER BY` what the questions asks

In this case, `student_id` and `subject_name`.

```SQL
SELECT
    stu.student_id
    , stu.student_name
    , sub.subject_name
    , COUNT(e.student_id) AS attended_exams
FROM Students stu
CROSS JOIN Subjects sub
LEFT JOIN Examinations e
ON 
    stu.student_id = e.student_id
    AND sub.subject_name = e.subject_name
GROUP BY
    stu.student_name
    , sub.subject_name
ORDER BY
    stu.student_id
    , sub.subject_name
```

```
| student_id | student_name | subject_name | attended_exams |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------ | -------------- |
| 1          | Alice        | Programming  | 1              |
| 1          | Alice        | Physics      | 2              |
| 1          | Alice        | Math         | 3              |
| 2          | Bob          | Programming  | 1              |
| 2          | Bob          | Physics      | 0              |
| 2          | Bob          | Math         | 1              |
| 13         | John         | Programming  | 1              |
| 13         | John         | Physics      | 1              |
| 13         | John         | Math         | 1              |
| 6          | Alex         | Programming  | 0              |
| 6          | Alex         | Physics      | 0              |
| 6          | Alex         | Math         | 0              |
```

### Solution
```sql
SELECT 
    stu.student_id
    , stu.student_name
    , sub.subject_name
    , COUNT(e.student_id) AS attended_exams
FROM Students stu
CROSS JOIN Subjects sub
LEFT JOIN Examinations e
ON 
    stu.student_id = e.student_id 
    AND sub.subject_name = e.subject_name
GROUP BY 
    stu.student_name
    , sub.subject_name
ORDER BY
    stu.student_id
    , sub.subject_name
```
