## [1633. Percentage of Users Attended a Contest](https://leetcode.com/problems/percentage-of-users-attended-a-contest/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)
* Easy Problem

### Concepts / Syntax
`SUB QUERY`, `GROUP BY` 

### Intuition
For this problem, we simply need to find the number of people that attend each contest and then divide that by the total number users.

### Approach
1. Find the number of users for each contest

```sql
SELECT 
    r.contest_id
    , COUNT(*) AS
FROM Register r
GROUP BY r.contest_id
```

```
| contest_id | COUNT(*) |
| ---------- | -------- |
| 215        | 2        |
| 209        | 3        |
| 208        | 3        |
| 210        | 3        |
| 207        | 1        |
```

2. Now we must find the **total** number of users. This can be done with a sub query from the `Users` table.
```sql
SELECT 
    r.contest_id
    , ROUND(COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users) * 100, 2) AS percentage
FROM Register r
GROUP BY r.contest_id
ORDER BY percentage DESC, r.contest_id ASC
```
```
| contest_id | percentage |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| 208        | 100        |
| 209        | 100        |
| 210        | 100        |
| 215        | 66.67      |
| 207        | 33.33      |
```

### Solution
```sql
SELECT 
    r.contest_id
    , ROUND(COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users) * 100, 2) AS percentage
FROM Register r
GROUP BY r.contest_id
ORDER BY percentage DESC, r.contest_id ASC
```
