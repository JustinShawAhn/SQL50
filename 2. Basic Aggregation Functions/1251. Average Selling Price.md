## [1251. Average Selling Price](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-selling-price/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)
* Easy Problem

### Concepts / Syntax
`BETWEEN`, `SUM()`, `IFNULL()`, `LEFT JOIN`, `GROUP BY`

### Intuition
Link sales transactions to their historical pricing records (using `LEFT JOIN` and `BETWEEN`) and then compute a sales-volume-adjusted average price for each product (using `SUM(price*units) / SUM(units))` , with a specific handling for products without sales `IFNULL()`.

### Approach
1. Link the `Prices` and `UnitsSold` table as we need infomation provided from both tables to do calculations.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Prices p
LEFT JOIN UnitsSold u
ON
    p.product_id = u.product_id
    AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date
```

```
| product_id | start_date | end_date   | price | product_id | purchase_date | units |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----- | ---------- | ------------- | ----- |
| 1          | 2019-02-17 | 2019-02-28 | 5     | 1          | 2019-02-25    | 100   |
| 1          | 2019-03-01 | 2019-03-22 | 20    | 1          | 2019-03-01    | 15    |
| 2          | 2019-02-01 | 2019-02-20 | 15    | 2          | 2019-02-10    | 200   |
| 2          | 2019-02-21 | 2019-03-31 | 30    | 2          | 2019-03-22    | 30    |
```

2. We now want to find the average price of each product.
> Note: a single product can have a price change during a different date which also has a different # of units sold. Therefore we `GROUP BY` the `p.product_id`

```SQL

SELECT
    p.product_id
    , ROUND(SUM(p.price * u.units) / SUM(units), 2) AS average_price
FROM Prices p
LEFT JOIN UnitsSold u
ON
    p.product_id = u.product_id
    AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date
GROUP BY p.product_id
```

```sql
| product_id | average_price |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| 1          | 6.96          |
| 2          | 16.96         |
```

3. We think we have finished the problem because we get one of the base cases right. However, issue with our finial solution if that we could have a null value in the `average_price` as some products may never have any units sold.
> Recall: we used `LEFT JOIN` to join `Prices` and `UnitsSold` so there could be a column of null values (units) in the resulting table

New solution:
```sql
SELECT
    p.product_id
    , ROUND(IFNULL(SUM(p.price * u.units) / SUM(u.units), 0), 2) AS average_price
FROM Prices p
LEFT JOIN UnitsSold u
ON
    p.product_id = u.product_id
    AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date
GROUP BY p.product_id
```

Now this:
```
| product_id | average_price |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| 1          | null          |
| 2          | null          |
```

Becomes this:
```
| product_id | average_price |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| 1          | 0             |
| 2          | 0             |
```



### Solution
```sql
SELECT
    p.product_id
    , ROUND(IFNULL(SUM(p.price * u.units) / SUM(u.units), 0), 2) AS average_price
FROM Prices p
LEFT JOIN UnitsSold u
ON
    p.product_id = u.product_id
    AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date
GROUP BY p.product_id
```
