## [1211. Queries Quality and Percentage](https://leetcode.com/problems/queries-quality-and-percentage/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)
* Easy Problem

### Concepts / Syntax
`AVG`, `IF`, `COUNT`, `GROUP BY`

### Intuition
For each query, calculate its quality (average of rating/position) using `AVG()` and the percentage of its poor queries (rating < 3) using `IF()`, `COUNT()` and `SUM()`. Round both to two decimal places.

### Approach
1. `GROUP BY` `query_name` as we want to perform aggreations on them
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Queries q
GROUP BY q.query_name
```
```
| query_name | result           | position | rating |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------ |
| Dog        | Golden Retriever | 1        | 5      |
| Cat        | Shirazi          | 5        | 2      |
```
2. Perform aggergation on the `GROUP BY` resulting rows
```sql
SELECT
    q.query_name
    , ROUND(AVG(q.rating / q.position), 2) AS quality
    , ROUND(SUM(IF(q.rating < 3, 1, 0)) / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM Queries q
GROUP BY q.query_name
```
```
| query_name | quality | poor_query_percentage |
| ---------- | ------- | --------------------- |
| Dog        | 2.5     | 33.33                 |
| Cat        | 0.66    | 33.33                 |
```

### Solution
```sql
SELECT
    q.query_name
    , ROUND(AVG(q.rating / q.position), 2) AS quality
    , ROUND(SUM(IF(q.rating < 3, 1, 0)) / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM Queries q
GROUP BY q.query_name
```
