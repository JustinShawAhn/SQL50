## [1174. Immediate Food Delivery II](https://leetcode.com/problems/immediate-food-delivery-ii/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)
* Medium Problem

### Concepts / Syntax
`SUB QUERY`, `WHERE`, `IN`, `GROUP BY`, `MIN()`

### Intuition
For this problem, we want find the first `order_date` for **each** `customer_id`. After the filter, we want to only have the customers that have the same `order_date` and `customer_pref_delivery_date` as the are the **immediate** customers

### Approach
1. Find the first `order_date` for **each** customer
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Delivery d
WHERE 
    (customer_id, order_date) IN
    (SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) FROM Delivery GROUP BY customer_id)
```
```
| delivery_id | customer_id | order_date | customer_pref_delivery_date |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------------------------- |
| 1           | 1           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 2           | 2           | 2019-08-02 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 5           | 3           | 2019-08-21 | 2019-08-22                  |
| 7           | 4           | 2019-08-09 | 2019-08-09                  |
```

2. Now we take only the rows that have the same `order_date` and `customer_pref_delivery_date` and divide that count by the total count
```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(SUM(IF(d.order_date = d.customer_pref_delivery_date, 1, 0)) / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM Delivery d
WHERE 
    (customer_id, order_date) IN
    (SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) FROM Delivery GROUP BY customer_id)
```
```
| immediate_percentage |
| -------------------- |
| 50                   |
```

### Solution
```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(SUM(IF(d.order_date = d.customer_pref_delivery_date, 1, 0)) / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM Delivery d
WHERE 
    (customer_id, order_date) IN
    (SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) FROM Delivery GROUP BY customer_id)
```
**ALSO**
```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(d.order_date = d.customer_pref_delivery_date) * 100, 2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM Delivery d
WHERE 
    (customer_id, order_date) IN
    (SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) FROM Delivery GROUP BY customer_id)
```
