## [1193. Monthly Transactions I](https://leetcode.com/problems/monthly-transactions-i/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)
* Medium Problem

### Concepts / Syntax
`DATE_FORMAT`, `IF()`, `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `GROUP BY`

### Intuition
We want to `GROUP BY` the **year and month**, however, we are given dates in year, month and day. We can make a new column with just the **year and month** using `DATE_FORMAT`.
After that we can group by the year and month to then perform simple aggregations

### Approach
Simple, does not require explination

### Solution
```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(t.trans_date, '%Y-%m') AS month
    , t.country
    , COUNT(*) AS trans_count
    , SUM(IF(t.state = 'approved', 1, 0)) AS approved_count
    , SUM(t.amount) AS trans_total_amount
    , SUM(IF(t.state = 'approved', amount, 0)) AS approved_total_amount
FROM Transactions t
GROUP BY month, t.country
```
